# Airbnb Clone â€” Data Flow Diagram

This folder contains the **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** for the Airbnb Clone backend project.

The diagram `data-flow.png` illustrates how data flows through the system, including:

- Key actors: Guests, Hosts, Admins
- Core processes: Authentication, Property Management, Booking, Payment, Reviews, Notifications, Admin operations
- Data stores: Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, Reviews, Messages

The DFD helps developers and stakeholders understand **how data moves within the backend system** and ensures all core operations are accounted for.
